Only problem: when we do not finish our bread quickly after buying it, it hardens and becomes stale. And we no longer dare to eat it for fear of breaking a tooth...",
"descconseil1.2" => "But instead of throwing the rest of our bread or our baguette in the trash, we will recycle it intelligently: either by mixing it to make breadcrumbs, or by dipping it in milk to make pudding, or by putting it in a pan with milk and sugar to make a delicious French toast... Yum!",
"conseil2" => "Use fruit and vegetable peels",
"descconseil2" => "The terrible thing about food waste is that we often do it without even knowing it. The proof: in 95% of cases, when you peel a fruit or vegetable, you throw the peelings in the trash without even thinking about it. Mistake !",
"descconseil2.2" => "Apple peels make excellent chips for an aperitif once you put them in the fryer! Radish or turnip tops are perfect in a good soup! And orange peel or clementine in the oven, nothing like removing bad smells. Spread the word, it's time to change our reflexes!",
"conseil3" => "Use leftover meat",
"descconseil3" => "When we leave our leftover meat too long in the fridge, the meat dries out and becomes very tough. Obviously, all this is not very greedy, and we often do not know what to do with this shoe sole lying around in our fridge!",
"descconseil3.2" => "What if we made a shepherd's pie? It's true: a leftover ground roast cooked with mashed potatoes is delicious, everyone loves it, and it allows us not to throw away the meat and finish our old potatoes. Jackpot!",
